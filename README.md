# Global Citizen Party

## Manifesto for a new global political party

We believe:

### A globalised world needs a global democratic governing body
- Some issues are too big for loose collectives of countries to solve
- Environmental health, food and water security, economic prosperity, warfare, and extra-planetary matters are too global to be controlled by anyone country

### Human rights are for all humans
- human shouldn't be subject to discrimination, exploitation, and in-access to basic resources for living

### Humans should have the right to movement
- Countries should embrace their cultural and boarder sovereignty, but not at the expense of global citizen's right to contribute to their prosperity

### Wealth inequality is a pandemic
- The prosperity of people is constantly undermined by rampant capitalism, a more moral system that incorporates people animals and planet needs to be moved too.
