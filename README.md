# Global Citizen Party

## Manifesto for a new global political party

We believe:

- A globalised world needs a global democratic governing body
  - Some issues are too big for loose collectives of countries to solve
  - Environmental health, food and water security, economic prosperity, warfare, and extraplanetory matters are too global to be controlled by anyone country
- Human rights are for all humans
  - human shouldn't be subject to discrimmination, exploitation, and inaccess to basic resources for living
- Humans should have the right to movement
  - Countries should embrace their cultural and boarder sovereignty, but not at the expense of global citizen's right to contribute to their prosperity
- Wealth inequality is a pandemic
  - The prosperity of people is constantly underminded by rampent capitalism, a more moral system that incorperates people animals and planet needs to be moved too.
